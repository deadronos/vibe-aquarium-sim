# TASK001 - Initialize memory bank

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09

## Original Request

Follow the repository memory-bank instructions and create or update necessary files under the `memory/` folder so project context, patterns and progress are recorded.

## Thought Process

The repository lacked core memory documents. The memory bank should include a short project brief, product context, active context, system patterns, tech context, progress summary and a requirements page so future work has continuity. Creating an initial task makes the change discoverable and follows the Memory Bank workflow.

## Implementation Plan

- Add core memory files in `memory/` (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md, requirements.md)
- Create `memory/tasks/_index.md` and `memory/tasks/TASK001-initialize-memory-bank.md`
- Add `memory/designs/_index.md` and a starter design note (next step)

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed

### 2025-12-09

- Created the core memory files under `memory/` (project brief, product/productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext, progress, requirements).
- Added the tasks index at `memory/tasks/_index.md` and this task file.
- Next: Add the designs index and an initial design file to document the memory-bank decision.
